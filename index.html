							<h2>Greg Goelzhauser</h2>
							<p>I'm a professor in the Department of Political Science at Utah State University, where I study courts using quantitative and historical methods (<a href="cv.pdf">CV</a>). Recent publications address topics such as constitutional accountability for police shootings, measuring case complexity, the Supreme Court's applications docket, and the impact of oral argument attendance on perceptions of judicial legitimacy and decision making. Prior research examines issues such as constitutional avoidance, dissent suppression, agenda setting, and designing state judicial selection and retention institutions. My research has been cited by the Supreme Court, as well as in state and federal court filings, state and federal legislative testimony, and national news outlets.
