        </center>


            <p>
            I'm an associate professor and director of graduate studies in the Department of Political Science at <a href="http://www.usu.edu/">Utah State University</a>.
            I'm also editor of the new Judicial Politics Book Series published by <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/">Temple University Press</a> and co-editor of the Annual Review of American Federalism published by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/publius">Publius: The Journal of Federalism</a>.
            My research and teaching interests are in American political institutions with an emphasis on law and courts.
            I'm particularly interested in three research streams concerning judicial power.
            </p>

            <p>
            One stream explores how institutional arrangements determining who exercises judicial power impact performance with respect to diversity and quality.
            On diversity I've examined the relationship between selection institutions and states seating apex court judges who are <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/book/20000000009216">women and people of color</a> as well as women of color in particular (forthcoming).
            Other research examines why states differ in the speed at which they seat their <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/lsr2011.pdf">first woman and black apex court judges</a>.
            And my recent book on the <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/book/20000000009889">inner workings of merit selection</a> analyzes whether women attorneys differentially exhibit expressive ambition in seeking judgeships, whether judges who are women or people of color differentially exhibit progressive ambition in seeking promotion, whether women are disadvantaged at the nomination or appointment stages (also in <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jlc2018.pdf">article</a> form), and whether design features implicating commission capture are associated with differences in seating women and people of color.
            </p>

            <p>
            The agenda's quality component includes my first book on the <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/book/20000000009216">comparative performance of selection institutions</a>, which in addition to analyzing diversification considers differences with respect to qualifications and experience.
            As with diversity, my <a href="http://tupress.temple.edu/book/20000000009889">second book</a> considers whether institutional design choices implicating commission capture in merit selection systems are associated with seating highly-qualified judges. I also examine whether qualifications are associated with expressive and progressive ambition as well as nominating commission and gubernatorial decision making (also in <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jlc2018.pdf">article</a> form).
            Additional research demonstrates that theoretical ambiguity leads to differences in <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/sppq2018.pdf">classifying selection institutions</a>, resulting in threats to inference when analyzing the relationship between institutional design and performance.
            Research on retention institutions addresses <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/sppq2014.pdf">opinion writing clarity</a> and <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jsj2012.pdf">case disposition speed</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
            The second stream explores the avoidance of judicial power. One article analyzes the political conditions under which the U.S. Supreme Court invokes procedural doctrines to <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/apr2011.pdf">avoid constitutional cases</a>.
            Additional research explores opinion suppression on the Court, including <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/cc2016.pdf">concurring</a> and <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jsch2017.pdf">dissenting</a> opinions while nonetheless noting disagreement.
            Other research uses <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jsch2015.pdf">historical</a> and <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/jsj2015.pdf">quantitative</a> evidence to understand why justices sometimes suppress any indication of disagreement and simply go along with the majority.
            Work on agenda setting examines how states can help <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/apr2013.pdf">secure Court review</a> by coordinating as amici and institutionalizing state solicitors general offices.
            A related paper considers the value of <a href="https://goelzhauser.github.io/articles/publius2015.pdf">ideologically heterogeneous state amici coalitions</a> in signaling information about case quality.
            </p>

            <p>
            In addition to continuing these research streams I'm in the early stages of a series of projects on how courts facilitate and constrain civil rights enforcement&mdash;particularly through qualified immunity and excessive force decisions in Section 1983 litigation.
            I'm also working with <a href="https://und.edu/directory/benjamin.kassow">Benjamin Kassow</a> and <a href="http://douglas-rice.net/">Douglas Rice</a> on developing a new measure of case complexity.
